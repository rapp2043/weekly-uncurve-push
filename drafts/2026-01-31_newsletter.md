SUBJECT LINE: The Peril of Good Intentions

In the summer of 1978, a criminologist named Joan McCord stood before a room of her peers at an academic conference. She was there to present the results of a study that had taken decades to complete, a monumental piece of research that tracked the lives of 506 boys from Cambridge and Somerville, Massachusetts. The room was likely filled with the usual hum of scholarly anticipation. These were men and women dedicated to fixing social problems, to intervening in the lives of troubled youth and setting them on a better path. McCord had the data in hand. And what she was about to say would shatter their fundamental assumption—that their help was, in fact, helpful.

The Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study had begun with the best of intentions back in 1939. The idea was straightforward, even noble: identify boys aged 5 to 13 who were at risk of delinquency, and provide them with a friendly counselor. These counselors would offer tutoring, take the boys to ball games, provide family support, and deliver a steady stream of positive mentorship. It was a classic intervention, the kind of program that makes intuitive sense. We believe that guidance and kindness can steer a young person away from trouble. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial, a gold standard in research. Half the boys got this benevolent attention; the other half, the control group, were left to their normal devices. The researchers then waited. They followed up after the program ended. The initial reports were optimistic, suggesting the program had little effect, but no harm. And then, thirty years later, Joan McCord dug deeper.

What she found was not a simple story of neutral outcomes. It was something far more disturbing. Using criminal records, mental health files, and death certificates, McCord compared the two groups as they entered middle age. The boys who had received the caring, intensive mentorship were *more* likely to have committed multiple crimes. They suffered higher rates of alcoholism and serious mental illness. They died younger. The warm hand of guidance, extended over years, had somehow left a cold fingerprint of harm. McCord’s presentation that day wasn’t just reporting a failed program. It was suggesting that the program itself had failed its subjects. The help had hurt.

But here’s the problem with a finding like that. It violates a sacred tenet of both social science and basic human decency: that trying to do good, especially for children, *is* good. The backlash was swift and severe. McCord later described colleagues who were “furious.” Her findings were attacked, dismissed as a fluke, an outlier, a case of faulty methodology. The pushback wasn’t merely academic disagreement; it was a visceral rejection of a profoundly uncomfortable truth. How could spending time with a caring adult cause damage? It made no sense. It was chaos where we expected order.

So let’s pause for a thought experiment. Imagine you’re a policymaker in the 1970s. Two reports land on your desk. One details a thrilling new program where hardened convicts scream at at-risk kids about the horrors of prison life, a program its creators call “Scared Straight.” The other is McCord’s dry, devastating report on Cambridge-Somerville. Which one resonates with your gut? The first is visceral, dramatic, and fits a satisfying narrative: shock them onto the right path. The second is a quiet, statistical murmur suggesting that your very instinct to intervene might be the problem. Which story would you fund?[^1]

McCord’s story is the story of an anomaly that became a pattern. For years, her work stood as a lonely monument to counterintuition. But slowly, painfully, other researchers began to find echoes of her discovery. In the 1990s and early 2000s, a series of systematic reviews examined hundreds of juvenile intervention programs—the boot camps, the counseling sessions, the group therapies. The results created a map of a bewildering landscape. Many programs showed no effect at all. A significant number, however, showed negative effects. They were making things worse. The most notorious were “peer-group” interventions, where teenagers with behavioral problems were brought together for counseling. The theory was that they could support each other. The reality, as research by sociologist Diane Felmlee and others pointed to, was that they often trained each other in delinquency, creating a network of reinforced bad behavior. The intervention had become a finishing school for crime.

This is where McCord’s deep dive starts to illuminate a dark corner of human psychology. The issue isn’t the intention; it’s the architecture. The Cambridge-Somerville program, for all its kindness, may have inadvertently stigmatized the boys, marking them as “problems” in their own minds and in their communities. It may have disrupted natural family or neighborhood supports by creating a dependency on an outsider who would eventually leave. It may have simply gathered together boys who, in slightly different circumstances, might have drifted apart, thereby consolidating a peer group prone to trouble. The intervention, in its clumsy, well-meaning attempt to impose order, created a new and more destructive kind of chaos.

The greatest resistance to McCord’s work didn’t come from a place of malice, but from a place of profound cognitive dissonance. We are wired to believe that action is superior to inaction, that doing something—anything—is better than doing nothing. This is especially true when faced with the suffering of a child. McCord’s research challenged that deepest of impulses. It suggested that in the complex, organic ecosystem of a human life, the introduction of a blunt-force instrument of help could throw everything out of balance. The systems we design to correct chaos are often blind to the hidden, adaptive order already in place—the fragile friendships, the family dynamics, the individual coping mechanisms—and our bulldozing good intentions can leave a field of wreckage.

Joan McCord kept going. She faced down the criticism and continued to publish, her work eventually gaining traction as the “what works” movement in criminology demanded harder evidence. She lived to see her once-heretical finding become a cornerstone of a more cautious, skeptical approach to social intervention. The lesson wasn’t that we should never help. It was that we must be terrifically humble about our ability to predict the consequences of that help. The road to harm, it turns out, is often paved with the very best intentions.

Today, when a new, intuitively appealing program promises to “solve” a complex social ill, the ghost of the Cambridge-Somerville study whispers a question. It’s the question Joan McCord learned to ask after years of pushback, a question that is the true legacy of her deep dive: **How do you know you’re not making it worse?**

[^1]: The “Scared Straight” program, despite its visceral appeal and popularity, was later subjected to rigorous evaluation. Systematic reviews, including those by the Campbell Collaboration, found that these programs not only failed to deter crime but likely increased the odds of offending. The drama of the intervention, much like the counseling in the Cambridge-Somerville study, became part of the problem.
