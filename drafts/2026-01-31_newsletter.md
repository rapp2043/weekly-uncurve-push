SUBJECT LINE: Why Success Breeds Failure

Aviv Kochavi, the former chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, is a man who has spent his life in rooms without windows. He is a strategist, a planner, a consumer of intelligence reports and probability matrices. In one such room, in the early hours of a morning this past spring, he and his team watched a scenario they had gamed out a thousand times begin to unfold in real time. Swarms of incoming drones and missiles, launched from a distant desert, appeared as streaks of light on their screens. The system, a marvel of modern engineering known as the Iron Dome, stirred to life. It had a near-legendary reputation, a 90% interception rate in previous conflicts, a statistical halo that felt less like a number and more like a guarantee.[^1] But on this night, something was off. The math didn’t hold. The streaks kept coming, and too many found their mark. In an interview months later, Kochavi would dissect the failure with the cold precision of a surgeon. He gave a technical reason—a gap in radar coverage. But then he offered a more haunting, human explanation. He called it the “paradox of success.” The very fact of their past triumphs, he argued, had planted the seeds for this present vulnerability.

We like to believe that success is cumulative. That winning begets more winning. We improve our systems, learn from our mistakes, and build higher walls against the chaos of the world. It’s a comforting and linear story of progress. But there’s a problem with that theory. History, and particularly the history of defense, suggests that the most catastrophic failures are often built on the foundations of our greatest victories. A perfect past can be the enemy of a secure future.

Consider, for a moment, the most famous defensive line that never was. After the horrific trench warfare of World War I, France was determined to never again be invaded through its northeastern frontier. Their solution was a masterpiece of military engineering: the Maginot Line. It was a vast, underground network of fortresses, armed with retractable turrets, connected by railways, stocked with supplies for months. It was designed to be impregnable, and in a sense, it was. When World War II began, the line held firm. German probes against it were futile. The French high command, veterans of the previous war, looked at their formidable walls and saw validation. Their strategy was working. The threat was being contained at the border, just as they had planned.

But here’s what happens when you build a perfect wall. You train your enemy to look for the door. The Germans, led by generals like Erich von Manstein, didn’t waste energy on the impossible. They looked at the map, saw the dense Ardennes Forest to the north of the Maginot Line—terrain the French considered “impassable” for a modern army—and decided that was exactly where they would go. In May 1940, German panzer divisions did not assault the fortresses. They slithered through the forest, a place the French defense plan had effectively written off because of their faith in their primary system. The Maginot Line itself was never breached. It was simply rendered irrelevant. The French had prepared diligently for the last war, for a repeat of the frontal assault. Their previous success in static defense had blinded them to the possibility of a maneuver they themselves had deemed illogical. The flawless performance of their wall in one context created a catastrophic blind spot in another.

This is the core of the paradox. Success doesn’t just teach the victor; it teaches the opponent, and often more effectively. It creates a template, a set of assumptions about how the next conflict will unfold. The Israeli military, after the stunning successes of the Iron Dome in 2014 and 2021, knew its system’s capabilities intimately. So did its adversaries. The interception rate wasn’t a secret; it was public record, a deterrent, and a challenge. Research in organizational behavior suggests a phenomenon known as the “success trap,” where entities become so committed to a proven recipe that they ignore changes in the environment that render it obsolete. You optimize for the known threat. You drill for the last attack. Your confidence becomes a cognitive filter, dismissing signals that don’t fit the pattern of your past wins.

Let’s play a quick thought experiment. Imagine you are tasked with defending a castle. You build a towering, unscalable wall on the southern side, where attacks have always come from. It works brilliantly. For decades, not a single southern assault succeeds. Your wall is hailed as a wonder. Now, ask yourself: where are you weakest? Your attention, your resources, your pride are all invested in that southern wall. The northern approach, rocky and difficult, seems less concerning. You might even downgrade its patrols to reinforce your celebrated success. You have, in effect, created an instruction manual for your own defeat. The instruction reads: *Go north.*

This is the subtle shift that Aviv Kochavi was describing. The Iron Dome’s radar system was configured, tuned, and positioned based on an exquisite understanding of past launch patterns—the angles, the locations, the volumes that had defined previous engagements. It was a system perfected for the attacks of yesterday. But a radar gap implies a zone of coverage that was considered lower-priority, a place from which a successful, large-scale attack was deemed unlikely based on historical data. The adversary, however, is not a passive actor. They are students of your success. They observed the dome’s shield, mapped its strengths, and went looking for its inevitable, corresponding weakness. They executed an attack that was, in military parlance, “asymmetric”—one designed not to overpower the system at its strongest point, but to bypass it entirely by striking where it wasn't looking.

This pattern echoes far beyond missile defense. It’s visible in business, where a company’s defining innovation (think of the original iPhone) can make it slow to see the next disruptive shift. It’s visible in medicine, where a standard, successful treatment protocol can blind doctors to a novel presentation of a disease. The past is not a blueprint for the future; it is, at best, a lesson in what has already been seen and solved. The danger lies in mistaking a solved problem for all possible problems.

So what do we make of Aviv Kochavi, in his windowless room, watching the streaks of light? His “paradox of success” is a profound and unsettling correction to our linear mindset. It tells us that our strengths catalog our vulnerabilities. That every victory writes a secret playbook for our defeat. The failure at Ramon was not, then, a simple malfunction. It was the culmination of a learning process—one in which the adversary had learned the most critical lesson. They learned that to defeat a system built on past success, you must do something the past never saw coming. The ultimate vulnerability of a perfect defense is the belief in its own perfection.

[^1]: This 90% figure, often cited in media reports, refers to interception rates during specific conflicts like the 2014 Gaza War and the 2021 conflict. It’s important to note that military officials often stress such statistics are estimates and can vary based on definitions of what constitutes an “interception” of a threat.
[^2]: A lesser-known but equally potent example is the Yom Kippur War of 1973. Israel’s stunning victory in the Six-Day War of 1967 created a pervasive belief in the supremacy of its armored forces and air force. This success led to a dismissive attitude toward enemy capabilities and new anti-tank and anti-aircraft technologies. Egypt and Syria’s initial, devastating attacks in 1973 succeeded precisely because they exploited this overconfidence, targeting the gaps Israeli success had created in its own vigilance.
